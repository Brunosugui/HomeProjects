First Arduino Project

-DHT11 sensor (humidity and temperature)
-Sound sensor
-PIR sensor (movement and presence)
-LDR application (Light Dependent Resistor)
-serial comunication with a ESP32 module

Project application:

on Arduino:
-clapper (two claps between 300 and 700ms) trigger DHT read data and send via Serial to pc
-PIR sensor trigger blueLed or redLed according to its digital output
-LDR used as voltage divisor ground resistor, measured its output voltage via analog pin and turn on/off a yellow led
    according to its value
-Serial with ESP32 module, listening to incoming data, and parse it

on ESP32:
-connect to wifi
-connect to mqtt broker server
-Serial with Arduino Uno
-listening to a topic (mqtt protocol) and parse its data. Send command to Arduino, such as temperature or humidity
-Arduino receives the comand and send the sensor reading back to ESP32
-When data is received from arduino, publish it on specific topics on broker server
